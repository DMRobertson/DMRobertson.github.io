		<h1>David&nbsp;M. Robertson</h1>
		<h2>Senior Software Engineer</h2>
		<p>
			I'm a senior software engineer specialising in distributed systems and concurrency, with 5 years' experience in the telecommunications industry.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was previously employed by <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> to work on <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>, an open-source, decentralised <abbr title="end-to-end encrypted">E2EE</abbr> messaging protocol.
			I was part of the team developing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> and operating its largest deployment: the flagship, Matrix.org.
			I also worked on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sliding-sync">sliding sync proxy</a>, in particular rapidly making it production-ready for <a href="https://element.io/labs/element-x">Element X's</a> release.
			I particularly enjoyed our book club. In 2022/23 I lead it through <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>. It was a lot of effort, but very rewarding.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before that, I worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarLeaf">StarLeaf</a> on their B2B video conferencing backend.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm most experienced in Python (4 years' commercial experience), C++17 (2 years') and Go (1 year), though I'm not tied to any particular language or ecosystem.
			It'd be nice to have an excuse to work with Rust, a Lisp, or a functional language.
		</p>

		<h2>Personal projects</h2>
		I occasionally tinker on programming projects in my spare time.
		Some highlights include:
		<dl>
			<dt>Contributions to the Python typing ecosystem</dt>
			<dd>I contributed some small stub fixes to <a class="software" href="">typeshed</a>, fixed a tricky problem in <a class="software" href="https://github.com/Shoobx/mypy-zope/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ADMRobertson+">mypy-zope</a>, and wrote the annotations for <a class="software" href="https://github.com/pyca/pynacl/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ADMRobertson+">pynacl</a>. If you'd like help getting annotations into your project, please get in touch!</dd>

			<dt><a href="https://github.com/DMRobertson/mal">Make a Lisp</a></dt>
			<dd>An interpreter for Joel Martin's <code>mal</code> language, based on his <a href="https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md">guide</a>.</dd>

			<dt><a href="https://dmrobertson.github.io/coding-demo/">Error correction demo</a></dt>
			<dd>A standalone webpage which visually demonstrates different kinds of forward error correction using an image of the user's choice.</dd>

			<dt><a class="software" href="https://thompsons-v.readthedocs.io/">thompson</a></dt>
			<dd>The software I wrote during my research, to calculate in the Thompson family of groups. It was good for testing ideas, validating calculations and <em>especially</em> good at generating illustrations for my thesis.</dd>
		</dl>

		<h2>Mathematics</h2>
		<p>
			In my previous life, I was a researcher in geometric group theory, supervised by <a href="https://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~najd2/">Dr.&nbsp;Andrew Duncan</a> and <a href="https://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~nser/">Prof.&nbsp;Sarah Rees</a>.
			 I was interested in:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem">Decision problems in group theory</a></li>
			<li>The extended family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_groups">Thompson-like groups</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory">Automata theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language">formal languages</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna_Neumann_conjecture">The Hanna Neumann conjecture</a> (now theorem) and its generalisations</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			My thesis <em><a href="https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/jspui/handle/10443/4727">Conjugacy and centralisers in Thompson's group <var>T</var></a></em> was accepted in
			It extends the work of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/francescomatucci/">Francesco Matucci</a> in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.2871">his PhD thesis</a> by
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>adapting his "stair algorithm" from&nbsp;<var>F</var> to&nbsp;<var>T</var>, and</li>
			<li>completing his analysis of centralisers in <var>T</var>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			 There's a <a href="downloads/project.pdf">more friendly explanation available here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			As part of my research, I wrote a package called <a class="software" href="https://github.com/DMRobertson/thompsons_v">thompson</a> to perform computations in these groups.
			It's not the fastest or most efficient tool out there&mdash;but it's good enough for testing conjectures.
			Indeed, it was robust enough to spot a technical error in a preprint!
			I worked with the authors to fix this before publication proper in
		</p>

			<dt><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218196716500144">The power conjugacy problem in Higman-Thompson groups</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01032">arÏ‡iv</a>). </dt>

		<h3>Talks</h3>
		<p>
			I ended up giving a variety of talks as a student.
			Here are some of the highlights.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><a href="downloads/sets/talk.html">The joy of sets</a>. </dt>
			<dd>A half-hour accessible postgraduate talk, to give a flavour of how sets can be used as a foundation for mathematics.</dd>

			<dt><a href="downloads/centralisers_in_T.pdf">On centralisers in Thompson's group <var>T</var></a>. </dt>
			<dd>A presentation of my thesis's main result, with an introduction to the relevant background and a sketch of its proof.</dd>

			<dt><a href="downloads/introduction_to_linux/intro_to_linux.pdf">Introduction to Linux</a>. </dt>
			<dd>Notes for other postgrad students to get used to Linux. Intended as a guide and a reference, giving students the confidence to use a terminal-only environment.	See also <a href="downloads/introduction_to_linux/demo.tar.gz">the demo files</a> referred to in the notes.</dd>

			<dt><a href="downloads/fractals.pdf">A spotter's guide to fractals</a>. </dt>
			<dd>A half-hour accessible postgraduate talk discussing fractals, trying to explain why Mandelbrot found them so engaging.</dd>
