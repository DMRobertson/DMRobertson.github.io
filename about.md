title: About me
---

I'm a Software Engineer in the media and signalling team at [StarLeaf](https://www.starleaf.com/)'s Watford office.

I work as part of the R&D team, developing and maintaining a range of applications and internal tools.
I primarily work with [C++(17)](https://isocpp.org), but also make use of [Python](https://python.org) and occasionally Javascript.
I'm keen to make use of [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), and I'd like to have an excuse to play around with Lisps and functional languages.

Before moving to software, I was [mathematics research student](/maths).
During that time I self-taught myself enough programming to be dangerous.
My favourite hobby projects include [the Python module I wrote during my studies](https://github.com/DMRobertson/thompsons_v); [Topological Connect Four](https://github.com/DMRobertson/tc4), a [coding theory demo](https://github.com/DMRobertson/coding-demo) for the course I taught, and a quick-and-dirty [Conundrum](https://github.com/DMRobertson/conundrum) game.
