title: About me

<p class="lead">
I'm a Software Engineer in the media and signalling team at <a href="https://www.starleaf.com">StarLeaf</a>'s Watford office.
</p>

I work as part of the R&D team, developing and maintaining a range of applications and internal tools.
I primarily work with [C++(17)](https://isocpp.org), but also make use of [Python](https://python.org) and occasionally Javascript.
I'm keen to make use of [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), and I'd like to have an excuse to play around with Lisps and functional languages.

Before moving to software, I was a [mathematics research student](/maths).
During that time I self-taught myself enough programming to be dangerous. 
My favourite hobby projects include [the Python module I wrote during my studies](https://github.com/DMRobertson/thompsons_v), [Topological Connect Four](https://github.com/DMRobertson/tc4), a [coding theory demo](https://github.com/DMRobertson/coding-demo) for the course I taught, and a quick-and-dirty [Countdown Conundrum](https://github.com/DMRobertson/conundrum) game.

Outside of computing, I enjoy puzzles, satire, wordplay, computer games and impressions. I have a soft spot for Doctor Who&mdash;lots of planets have a north!
