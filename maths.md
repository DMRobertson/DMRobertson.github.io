In my previous life, I was a PhD researcher in geometric group theory, supervised by [Dr. Andrew Duncan](https://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~najd2/) and [Prof. Sarah Rees](https://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~nser/).
I was interested in:

* [decision problems in group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem),
* the extended family of [Thompson-like groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_groups),
* [automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory) and [formal languages](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language), and
* [the Hanna Neumann conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna_Neumann_conjecture) (now theorem) and its generalisations.
   
My thesis *[Conjugacy and centralisers in Thompson's group T](downloads/thesis_resubmitted.pdf)* was accepted in May 2019.
It extends the work of [Francesco Matucci](https://sites.google.com/site/francescomatucci/) in [his PhD thesis](https://arxiv.og/abs/0807.2871) by

* adapting his "stair algorithm" from F to T, and
* completing his analysis of centralisers in T.

There's a [more friendly explanation available here](downloads/project.pdf).
    
During my studies I wrote the <a class="software" href="https://github.com/DMRobertson/thompsons_v">thompson</a> package for [Python](https://python.org) to help compute in Thompson's groups.
   It's not the fastest or most efficient tool out there, but it's good enough for testing conjectures. It's certainly much better at performing calculations than I ever was!

## Papers
I didn't end up publishing much.
At some point I planned to chop the thesis up into two papers: roughly speaking, one for each of the two main results.
I never got round to that.

[The power conjugacy problem in Higman-Thompson groups](https://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218196716500144) ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01032)). March 2016.
: with [Nathan Barker](https://www.nodes.ac.uk/dr-nathan-barker/) and [Andrew Duncan](https://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~najd2/).

## Teaching
I delivered the 2017/18 edition of [Newcastle's course on Coding Theory](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/module.php?code=MAS8704). This was a one-semester module delivered to around 90 students. I also made a toy application to visualise [the effect of error correcting codes](https://dmrobertson.github.io/coding-demo).
